# A Machine Learning-Based Lightweight Intrusion Detection System for the Internet of Things

## Purpose
This project aims to design and implement a lightweight, efficient, and accurate Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that enhances the security of Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system identifies malicious activities in real time while maintaining low computational overhead, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained IoT environments.

This work builds upon ongoing research efforts, exemplified by our IEEE conference paper titled **“Improving Healthcare Outcomes: Doctor Classification and Performance Prediction via ML”**, accepted with major revisions for presentation at the 3rd International Conference on Augmented Intelligence and Sustainable Systems (ICAISS-2025) at CARE College of Engineering, Trichy (May 2025). This achievement reflects our strong competency in applying machine learning to solve domain-specific, real-world problems.
